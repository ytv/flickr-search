# Flickr Search Demo

Use this app to search through Flickr's public photo feed by tag.

Frameworks & Modules leveraged:  
Angular.JS  
Boostrap (UI)  
ngInfiniteScroll

### Notes

```
1. Upon the initial load, the app defaults to the search results for the tag 'sunset'.

2. Unfortunately, Flickr's public data feed only returns 20 images. Therefore in order
to fully demonstrate this project, the same 20 images are repeatedly used to load the
page as you scroll down.
```
